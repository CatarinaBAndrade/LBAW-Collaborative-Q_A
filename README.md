It is intended to develop an information system with a web interface to manage a community of collaborative questions and answers. Any registered user can submit questions or answers. The questions and answers can be voted on by the rest of the community. It is also possible to associate brief comments to the questions or the answers. Each user has an associated score that is calculated considering the votes on its questions and answers.
